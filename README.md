# Optimization-of-Energy-Absorbent-Shells-discontinuities-Size-and-shape-in-Julia
In this research, the energy-absorbing behavior of some thin wall shell will be investigated by numerical solution in finite element method and in Abaqus software, and the size and shape of the absorber will be Optimized with proper discontinuities.
